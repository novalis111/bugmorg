# BugmOrg

BugmOrg is a Bugging Task Reminder for [Emacs orgmode](https://orgmode.org/). It was created out of the need for a 
reminder that would not give up, even when postponed indefinitely. Specifically designed for people
with ADHD who suffer from poor executive function and are great in consequently ignoring every
kind of ToDo-List, App, Reminder, PostIt Notes... 

I needed something that would remind me, even when I do not check the list. Something that
comes up every time reminds me regularly without me having to think about it. That is where 
BugmOrg comes in. It shows ONE task every time you unlock your phone, is relatively easy to 
dismiss but comes back often, with other colors, motivational quotes and some other gimmicks 
the ADHD brain hopefully responds to.

## Usage

Install, grant permissions and disable battery saving. BugmOrg runs a background service, that 
shows a splash screen every time you unlock your phone. It does not offer editing or "checking off" 
tasks, you need to use another app for that. I recommend [Orgzly](https://orgzly.com/) for adding, 
editing and checking off tasks. In combination these apps provide a simple but flexible way to 
work with Lists and Notes, and hopefully help you getting things done.
